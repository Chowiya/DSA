# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM

## DATA STRUCTURE:

A data structure is specific way of oranizing, storing and accessing data.

## ALGORITHM:

A set of instruction that tells a computer how to do something, or you can say step-by-step solution of the problem is call algorithm.

# Big o notation:

Big o notation helps us understand how long an algorithm will take to run or how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows 
1. Time complexity.
2. Space complexity.
